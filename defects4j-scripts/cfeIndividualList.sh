#The purpose of this script is to Create, Fix and Test test suites for several defects4j bugs.

#Preconditions:
#There should be a folder called generatedTestSuites in the defects4j folder where the test suites and their output will be stored.
#The variable D4J_HOME should be directed to the folder where defects4j is installed.
#The variable JAVA_HOME should be directed to the folder where java 7 is installed (It must be Java 7).
#You should manually modify the list of bugs to be ran in the array called "bugs"

#Output
#The output is a txt file with the output of testing the test suite on the folder indicated. The name of the txt file is: EvaluatingTestSuite"$PROJECT"-"$BUGNUMBER"f-evosuite-branch."$SEED".tar.bz2On"$LOWERCASEPACKAGE""$BUGNUMBER"BuggyOutput.txt and it is located in $D4J_HOME/generatedTestSuites/$IDENTIFIER/"$PROJECT"/evosuite-branch/"$SEED"/ for each of the d4j bugs

#Parameters:
# 1th param is the generation tool (Randoop or Evosuite)
# 2th param is the budget of time in seconds the tool has to generate the test suite
# 3th param is weather you want to run only sections of the script: C=create, F=fix. You can run: CF, C, F
# 4th param is the name of the folder the test suite will be stored in. This is located in $D4J_HOME/generatedTestSuites/ . Example: September21
# 5th param is the path of the folder to evaluate the test suite on, starting from the the D4J_HOME folder (Example: ExamplesCheckedOut or BugsWithAFix)

#Example of usage:
#./cfeIndividualList.sh Randoop 180 CFE September21
